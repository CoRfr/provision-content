This is some notes to remind Greg about how this gets built in travis.

e-info.tgz.enc is an encrypted tar ball that contains the following files:
  cicd
  cicd.pub
  dr_info

cicd and cicd.pub are private/public keys that are registered with RackN to be injected into the 
created nodes in packet.  all the test commands use those keys.

dr_info is the packet variables needed to drive packet - API key and Project key

These are tarred up and encrypt by travis with a key in travis land.

.travis.yaml uses the key in travis and the encrypted tarball to run unit tests if enabled.

On Greg's laptop there are unencrypyt files and the base travis keys.

If this needs to be updated, travis command from cli can be used to re-encrypt the file.
This would be accompanied with an update to .travis.yaml to make sure we use the correct
key in travis.  This is non-obvious and a little tricky.
