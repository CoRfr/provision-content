Name: "prom-mon-single-node"
Description: "drp-prom-mon single-node (drp, node-exporter, prometheus, grafana)"
Documentation: |
  This profile defins the install of a drp-prom-mon cluster in one step.
  DRP, Node Exporter, Prometheus, and Grafana components will be
  installed.  All pieces are installed on a single Machine.

  You do NOT need to clone this profile as it doesn't require write
  access to the Params for a Single Node install.

  The 'drp-prom-mon/node-exporter' is set to loopback address because
  we are only running on a single machine instance.

  The Machines must have a supported OS installed, and the 'drpcli'
  runner Agent must be running.
