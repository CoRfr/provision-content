Description: "The machine that the Node Exporter will run on."
Documentation: |
  This param will be set to the Machine IP address that
  the Node Exporter will be running on.  Node Exporter will
  feed metrics to the Prometheus/Grafana instance

  Prometheus pulls stats, so no need to configure the Node
  Exporter to know about it.  However, Prometheus DOES
  need to be configured to know about Node Exporter to scrape
  stats.

  This Param is used in the Prometheus install task.
