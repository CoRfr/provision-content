Name: "sonobuoy/wait-mins"
Description: "Minutes to wait for Sonobuoy run to complete"
Documentation: |
  Default is -1 so that stages do not wait for complete.

  Typical runs may take 60 minutes.

  If <0 then code does wait and assumes you will run it again to retrieve the results.
  Task is idempotent so you can re-start a run after you have started to check on results.
