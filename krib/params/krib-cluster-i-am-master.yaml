Name: "krib/i-am-master"
Description: "Cause member nodes to assume a GKC master role"
Documentation: |
  When this param is set to true AND the krib/selective-mastership param is set to true,
  then this node will participate in mastership election. On the other hard, if this param
  is set to false (the default), but krib/selective-mastership param is set to true, then
  this node will never become a master. This option is useful to prevent dedicated workers from
  assuming mastership.

  Defaults to 'false'.
