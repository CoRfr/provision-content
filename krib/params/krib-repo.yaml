Name: "krib/repo"
Description: "URL path to a pre-prepared collection of necessary KRIB install files"
Documentation: |
  Allows operators to pre-prepare a URL (i.e., a local repository) of the installation packages necessary for KRIB. 
  If this value is set, then tasks like containerd-install and etcd-config will source their installation files
  from this repository, rather than attempting to download them from the internet (which may take longer, given
  the amount of machines to be installed plus the capacity of the internet service)
