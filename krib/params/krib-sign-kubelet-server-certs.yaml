Name: "krib/sign-kubelet-server-certs"
Description: "Whether to sign the kubelet server certs using the CA, or leave them as self-signed (default)"
Documentation: |
  When this param is set to true, then the kubelets will be configured to request their certs from
  the cluster CA, using CSRs. The CSR approver won't natively sign server certs, so a custom operator,
  "https://github.com/kontena/kubelet-rubber-stamp", will be deployed to sign these.

  Defaults to 'false'.
