Name: "krib-helm"
Description: "KRIB install helm and tiller on the cluster"
Documentation: |
  Installs and runs Helm Charts after a cluster has been constructed.
  This stage is idempotent and can be run multiple times.
  This allows operators to create workflows with multiple instances of this stage.
  The charts to run are determined by the helm/charts parameter.

  Due to helm downloads, this stage requires internet access.

  This stage also creats a tiller service account.  For advanced security, this
  configuration may not be desirable.
