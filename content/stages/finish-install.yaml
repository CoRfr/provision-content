Name: "finish-install"
Description: "Stage to indicate that all the install tasks are done and the system should complete the OS install"
Documentation: |
  Deprecated!

  Originally, this stage was used with the STOP runner action in the change-stage/map.

  Going forward, the STOP action is not required.  The changing of bootenv from something-install to
  local will cause the runner to exit.

  The runner will also continue to run regardless of the RunnerWait flag.
BootEnv: "local"
