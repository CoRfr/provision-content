Description: "Simplest Ubuntu Install Workflow"
Documentation: |
  This workflow is the most basic Ubuntu provisioning process for DRP.

  After the install completes, the complete Stage leaves the runner
  in a waiting state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a
  new workflow if the Machine.Workflow is updated.

  NOTE: To enable, upload the Ubuntu-18.04 ISO as per the ubuntu-18.04 BootEnv
Stages:
  - ubuntu-18.04-install
  - complete
