Description: "Simplest CentOS Install Workflow"
Documentation: |
  This workflow is the most basic CentOS provisioning process for DRP.

  After the install completes, the complete Stage leaves the runner
  in a waiting state so that DRP will automatically detect and start a
  new workflow if the Machine.Workflow is updated.

  NOTE: To enable, upload the CentOS ISO as per the centos-7 BootEnv
Stages:
  - centos-7-install
  - finish-install
  - complete
