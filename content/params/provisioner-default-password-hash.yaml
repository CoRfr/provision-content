Description: "Defines the password of the default user in hash form"
Documentation: |
  This specifies the password hash to use for the install process.  This is the 
  root password on CentOS-based installs and the default user on the Debian-based
  installs.

  To generate a hash, use the following command:

    echo 'import crypt,getpass; print crypt.crypt(getpass.getpass(), "$6$16_CHARACTER_SALT_HERE")' | python -

  Set your 16 character salt in the correct place.  This generate sha512 hash which should work on both
  operating system types.
