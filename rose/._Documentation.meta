Rebar OpenStack Environment (ROSE)
==================================

ROSE runs OpenStack DevStack to setup a single master, multinode cluster as per https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/; consequently, the install uses the same superuser grants that are required by DevStack.

THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION INSTALLATION 

The ROSE content follows other Digital Rebar cluster installation patterns: a shared profile must be created with the name of the profile defined in the Param 'rose/profile-name' and then machines must have that profile to use a ROSE workflow.  A sample workflow and profile are provided as examples.

The system is designed for testing use so Sledgehammer is the base install.

Limitations
-----------

* The current system is hardwired to use eth0
* DevStack only supports a single master

Todo:
-----

* Compute notes should wait for Controller to finish
* Send final output from DevStack run
* Support for floating networks has been enabled
* Explicit fixed network range has been added
